# Store-Database-GUI
This is a program I began writing after I took my Databases course my Junior Year. It utilizes a Java GUI and a PostgreSQL database.
It is currently in the beginning stages of development. 

I am wanting to create a "Wal-Mart like" GUI for which a cashier might use to check out products. In order to do this, I will have to define the database with a CASHIER table and an ITEM table. The CASHIER table will contain a list of current cashiers that work for the company. The ITEM table will have items that the store currently has in stock. I have not yet established primary keys or attributes, as I am still in the beginning stages of this project.
